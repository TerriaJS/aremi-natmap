Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at:<br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/><strong>These maps</strong> indicate that CSP could avoid the need for network augmentation in 48 locations, or 72% of the constrained locations examined. If only locations with solar resources better than 21 MJ/m2/day DNI are included, CSP could avoid the need for augmentation at 94% of locations.<ul><li>The coloured shapes mark the grid constraints in areas where the solar resource is sufficiently high to warrant the investigation of CSP. A <strong>circle</strong> shows that CSP is able to meet the network constraint; a <strong>square</strong> that CSP cannot meet the constraint; and a <strong>triangle</strong> is where there is insufficient information to reach a conclusion.</li><li>The colour of the shape indicates the CSP cost-gap <emph>after</emph> taking into account a network support payment. Green areas are where the modelling indicates a positive CSP business case, while red indicates a substantial cost-gap.</li><li>The size of the circle is proportional to the most cost effective plant capital cost</li><li>Clicking on a shape gives detailed information.</li></ul><br/><br/>Altogether, installation of 533MW of CSP at grid constrained locations was found to be cost effective during the next 10 years, and an additional 125MW had a cost benefit greater than -$20/MWh. Installation of this CSP would save approximately 1.9 MT of greenhouse gases per year.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps:<br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-3a.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-3a.html)"
