Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com.

This has been informed through desktop research and targeted consultation to understand the nature and availability of organic wastes produced, including the location of facilities, production size and subsequent residue generation.<p>To determine the locations of major facilities at SA2 level, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) databases were utilised.

This assumes that the point of residue generation for grapes and almonds is the point of processing. <p>The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities, Australia, 2014-15 (7121.0) dataset (ABS, 2016a). Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level. It was used to disaggregate the values from the 2014-15 REACS dataset at SA4 level on a proportional basis provided by the 2010-11 dataset. The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period. However, this has not been captured in this modelling approach, with the 2014-15 data directly disaggregated based on the geographical distribution presented in the 2010-11 data. <p>Residue factors were applied to annual 2014-15 production values based on desktop research and industry consultation and feedback. <p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.

This assumes that the point of residue generation for grapes and almonds is the point of processing. <p>The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities, Australia, 2014-15 (7121.0) dataset (ABS, 2016a). Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level. It was used to disaggregate the values from the 2014-15 REACS dataset at SA4 level on a proportional basis provided by the 2010-11 dataset. The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period. However, this has not been captured in this modelling approach, with the 2014-15 data directly disaggregated based on the geographical distribution presented in the 2010-11 data. <p>Residue factors were applied to annual 2014-15 production values based on desktop research and industry consultation and feedback. <p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.

Hardwood and softwood sawlog production from plantations for each SA2 region was estimated by calculating the per ha volume of hardwood and softwood sawlogs using plantation log supply forecasts (ABARES 2016b) for the period 2016-20 for each NPI region, then multiplying these figures by the areas of softwood and hardwood plantations within each SA2 region within the respective NPI region.  <p>The proportions of hardwood (85%) and softwood (69%) sawlogs processed in Victorian sawmills were estimated from a number of sources: The remaining hardwood and softwood sawlogs are not processed in Victorian sawmills. ABARES data for total sawlog production for the period 2010-15, sawn timber recovery estimates (R%) for hardwood and softwood timber produced in Victoria from Gavran et al (2014), and actual amounts of hardwood and softwood sawn timber produced in Victoria for 2010-15.  These proportions were multiplied by the total volumes of hardwood and softwood sawlogs produced in Victorian plantations to estimate the volume of logs processed in Victorian sawmills.  <p>These sawlog volumes were converted to dry matter weight using wood density figures for plantation hardwood (Eucalyptus globulus) and softwood (Pinus radiata) logs, published by the FPC (2016), and native hardwood logs, published by Wood Solutions (2013).  Sawlog dry weights were then multiplied by 100-R% to estimate the total amount of sawdust and woodchip residues produced by softwood and hardwood sawmills.  Based on data from Greaves and May (2015), it was assumed that sawdust comprised 31% of wood residues from softwood mill and 43% of the residues from hardwood mills, with woodchips comprising the remainder.  It was also assumed (based on data from Greaves and May 2015) that bark (which is not included in the total log volumes) made up an additional 8% of the dry weight of softwood logs and 1% of the dry weight of hardwood logs. <p>It should be noted that most sawmill residues are currently utilised. Wood chips are mostly used for pulp and paper production (either locally or exported overseas), sawdust and shavings are burnt for heat production to kiln dry timber, and bark and sawdust are sold for potting mix or animal bedding.<p>Use the NPI boundaries and Plantations layers (located in the forestry folder) with this layer to see the point source locations of production across the NPI regions, against the modelled residues at SA2 level. However, note that sawmill locations have not been indicated in this layer and therefore the locations provided are based on the locations of plantations, not the locations of sawmills. <p>Results based on this approach are based on national log volumes for 2016-20.",

The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level. It was used to disaggregate the values from the 2014-15 REACS dataset at SA4 level on a proportional basis provided by the 2010-11 dataset. The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period.

Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level. It was used to disaggregate the values from the 2014-15 REACS dataset at SA4 level on a proportional basis provided by the 2010-11 dataset. The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period. However, this has not been captured in this modelling approach, with the 2014-15 data directly disaggregated based on the geographical distribution presented in the 2010-11 data. <p>Residue factors were applied to annual 2014-15 production values based on desktop research and industry consultation and feedback. <p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.

                "content": "The data presented for Victoria in AREMI are the results of modelling the quantities of biomass residue generated throughout the state across Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and several industries in the Commercial and Industrial (C&I) and Construction and Demolition (C&D) sectors. <p>Data for all modelled residue generation has been presented at a Local Government Area (LGA) equivalent. Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com.
